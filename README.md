# 7SegmentControl

# Description
This project allows the control of the seven-segment display on the BASYS3 FPGA Board. Using the switches on the board, you can change select which digit you want to adjust and set it to a number ranging from 0-9. 

#Components
* __FPGA__: You will need a FPGA with a seven segment display. I am using the BASYS3, but you can run the Verilog code on a different board. The refresh rate for the LEDs and the constraints may need to be adjusted, however
